### 🌱 Always Evolving
I’m passionate about people, performance, and problem-solving — and I’m always learning something new.  
This space (and I) will continue to evolve as I do.

### 🧭 About Me
After completing 23 Spartan races, I’ve traded obstacle course mud runs for competitive pickleball — but the mindset remains the same: give it everything you’ve got, stay resilient, and keep a sense of humor along the way.

I like to win, but only when it’s done the right way — with integrity, teamwork, and persistence. Every role I’ve taken on, I’ve treated like it’s my own business. I care deeply about the work, the people, and the impact.

I’m an autodidact by nature, endlessly curious and hands-on, whether it’s diving into new technology, tackling a home project, or exploring better tools that make work more efficient. At my core, I’m a people-centered leader who believes great results come from trust, ownership, and the kind of energy that makes others want to be part of it.

### ⚙️ Working Styles

**Open Communication**  
I value clarity and collaboration. If something feels unclear, I prefer to talk it through rather than let it linger. I encourage open feedback and create space where ideas are heard and valued.

**Empowerment & Autonomy**  
I align early on goals and expectations, then give people the trust and space to deliver. I’m here to support, remove barriers, and celebrate wins along the way.

**Proactive Planning**  
I like to stay one step ahead—anticipating needs, building pipelines, and preparing for what’s next. I rely on data, dashboards, and structured plans to create freedom later.

**Development & Coaching**  
Helping others grow is one of the most fulfilling parts of what I do. I hold regular 1:1s and development conversations, often using tools like StrengthsFinder to build awareness and confidence.

**Change & Innovation**  
I view change as an opportunity. I’m comfortable building structure out of ambiguity and thrive in fast-moving, evolving environments.

**Creativity & Culture**  
I believe performance and positivity can coexist. I bring energy, creativity, and a sense of fun to teamwork and client partnerships.

**Balance & Boundaries**  
I work with urgency and focus but also know when to step back, reflect, and reset. Balance often brings clarity that pure effort alone can’t.
