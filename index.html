      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m passionate about people, performance, and problem solving. I bring a competitive, collaborative spirit to everything I do. After running 23 Spartan races, I’ve traded obstacle course mud runs for competitive pickleball, but the mindset is the same: give it everything you’ve got, stay resilient, and keep a sense of humor along the way.</p>
      <p>Do I like to win? YES, but only when it’s done the right way. I take pride in earning results through integrity, teamwork, and persistence. One of my favorite things is celebrating big wins with my team and making sure every person feels valued for their part in the success.</p>
      <p>Every role I’ve ever taken on, I’ve treated like it’s my own business. I care deeply about the work, the people, and the impact. I’m an autodidact by nature, endlessly curious and constantly learning, especially hands on, whether it’s diving into new technology, tackling a home improvement project (thank goodness for YouTube), or experimenting with tools that make work more efficient.</p>
      <p>At my core, I’m a people centered leader who believes great results come from trust, ownership, and the kind of energy that makes others want to be part of it.</p>

      <h2>Working Styles</h2>

      <h3>Open Communication</h3>
      <p>I’m big on clarity and collaboration. If something feels unclear, I’d rather talk it through than let it linger. I encourage open, honest feedback and believe in creating a space where everyone’s ideas are heard and valued.</p>

      <h3>Empowerment and Autonomy</h3>
      <p>I don’t micromanage. I prefer to align early on goals and expectations, then give you the trust and space to deliver. I’m here to support, remove barriers, and celebrate wins along the way.</p>

      <h3>Proactive Planning</h3>
      <p>I like to stay one step ahead anticipating needs, building pipelines, and preparing for what’s next. You’ll often see me working from detailed plans, dashboards, and tear sheets because I believe preparation creates freedom and flexibility later.</p>

      <h3>Development and Coaching</h3>
      <p>Helping others grow is one of the most fulfilling parts of what I do. I hold regular one on ones and development conversations, often using tools like StrengthsFinder to build awareness and collaboration. I’ll challenge you, support you, and help you build confidence in your role.</p>

      <h3>Change and Innovation</h3>
      <p>I view change as an opportunity. Whether it’s adopting new tools, trying a new sales approach, or refining a process, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. I’m comfortable building structure out of ambiguity and thrive in fast moving, evolving environments.</p>

      <h3>Creativity and Culture</h3>
      <p>I like to bring energy and positivity into the workplace whether that’s through creative problem solving, themed client visits, or celebrating team wins. I believe joy and performance can coexist.</p>

      <h3>Balance and Boundaries</h3>
      <p>I like to move with urgency and focus, but I also know when it’s time to pause, look at the data, and take in the bigger picture. I’m malleable and not afraid to admit when something didn’t work; I learn fast and adjust just as quickly. Sometimes that clarity comes during a walk, a breath, or a quiet moment to think. Balance has a way of revealing solutions that force alone can’t.</p>
